## Synopsis

This is a website for the Movie Trailer Website project for Udacity FSND. It is written in python along with HTML, CSS, jQuery.

## Code Example

In order to generate a movie in python use media.Movie(title, storyline, poster, trailer, duration, rating)
In order to generate a tvshow in python use media.Movie(title, storyline, poster, trailer, duration, rating, episodes, seasons)

Although this is not necessary as there is a loop implemented that goes through the videos.json file and outputs everything to the website from there.

So in order to add a new movie or tvshow open up videos.json and add it there. 


## Motivation

This is a part of Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. This is the first project I have made and the first projet I have made writing python. Took about 3 hours to complete. My motivation for this is to learn and be able to develop in Python.

## Installation

In order to generate the website you need to run the entertainment_center.py
